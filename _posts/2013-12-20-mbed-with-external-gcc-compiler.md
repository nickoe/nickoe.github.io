This is a small note on how to use a [mbed.org] project and build it
locall with gcc.

If you get the error

	arm-none-eabi-gcc: error: nano.specs: No such file or directory

this most likely means that you have not installed the [newlib-nano].
To still be able to compile with just the [newlib], then you can just
remove the `--specs=nano.specs` from the `LD_FLAGS` variable in the
`Makefile` generated by [mbed.org]. Now back to work!
